# Database-Backup
Database backup is the process of backing up the operational state, architecture and stored data of database software. It enables the creation of a duplicate instance or copy of a database in case the primary database crashes, is corrupted or is lost. Many developers have complaint about ways to take full backup of their database. I believe this solution should solve their problem.
#MSSQL-SERVER

#MYSQL-SERVER
